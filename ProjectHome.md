ASPERES is the Audio Spectrograph and Re-Synthesis program based on the ARSS utility originally created by Michel Rouzic (http://arss.sf.net). It can convert WAV sound samples to BMP images (spectrograms) and arbitrary BMP images to sound (WAV).

The original program used to be a console program with rather limited interactive parameter entry capabilities (it could also be used as a command line utility). Development proceeded  up to version 0.2.3, then Michel decided to add a GUI and convert ARSS to a non-free program called Photosounder (http://photosounder.com). It is a significantly enhanced version that is capable of much more than ARSS, but it is not free anymore.

ARSS has been abandoned, its development stopped. I have decided to take up development. I plan to add a simple GUI to create a free version of ARSS that is easier to use than the original console / command line version. The program should also be extended to handle more sound and image formats.

ASPERES is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.
