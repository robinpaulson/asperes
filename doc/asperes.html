<h3>1. Summary</h3>

<p>
Audio Spectrograph and Re-Synthesis (ASPERES) is a small command line utility
that can generate images (spectrograms) from sound samples, and sounds from
arbitrary images.

<h3>3. History</h3>

<p>
ASPERES is based on <a href="http://arss.sf.net">ARSS</a> which was originally
created by Michel Rouzic in 2005 and went up to version 0.2.3 (the last
publicly available version). Later Michel extended and converted ARSS to a
commercial program called <a href="http://photosounder.com"> Photosounder</a>.
ARSS has been abandoned. I (Laszlo Menczel) found the original program and
took up its further development in August 2010.

<h3>4. Operation</h3>

<a name="launch">
<h4>4.1. Launching the program</h4>

<p>
The latest version of ASPERES is a command line utility which requires that
all parameters be specified when the program is started (i.e. it has no
interactive parameter entry functions). The best way of using ASPERES is
scripting (Windows batch files, Unix shell scripts) to avoid repeated
typing of parameter lists on the command line.
</p>

<p>
In order to make ASPERES easier to use, it has been extended by adding a
flexible system of configuration files (simple ASCII text files).
Almost all parameters may be defined in such files. The syntax of
parameter definition in config files is described in
<a href="asperes.html#sect6"> Section 6</a>.
</p>

<p>
ASPERES uses default config file(s) if avalilable. If the environmental
variable ASPERES_HOME is defined, the program will try to read a config file
called 'asperes.ini' from that location. If the environmental variable is
unset, then ASPERES tries to read this file from the current working directory.
In case if both files are present then the one in the current working
directory takes precedence. If the file cannot be found then the parameters
of ASPERES remain unset (undefined).
</p>

<p>
It is possible to instruct ASPERES to use a config file in a different location
by using the '-c' command line argument (see <a href="asperes.html#sect5">
Section 5</a>).
</p>

<p>
Please note that parameter settings read from a config file have a lower
precedence and can always be overridden by specifying new values on the
command line.
</p>

<a name="oper">
<h4>4.2. Operational modes</h4>

<p>
There are three available processing modes in the ASPERES. The first one is
analysis, the process by which a sound is turned into an image (called a
spectogram).
</p>

<p>
The two other processing modes are synthesis modes. They turn images
into sounds. Sine and noise synthesis differ slightly in the sound they
produce because of what type of sound they are based on. Whereas sine
synthesis consists in mixing together a bunch of modulated sines, which
is what anyone would think of as pure tones, noise synthesis replaces
these pure tones with band-pass filtered noise. The first auditory
difference between the two is that if you synthesise from a plain white
image, with sine synthesis it will sound as if someone just sat on a
church organ's keyboard, as with noise synthesis it will sound like pink
noise (which sounds like white noise except with less treble and more
bass).
</p>

<p>
Another difference can be pictured as follows. Picture an image, let's
say a spectrogram, that we would vertically enlarge using two different
methods. The first method would simply consist in smoothly enlarging in,
in the same way you'd expect any decent image editing program to do.
That would be noise synthesis. Now, imagine that instead of doing that,
we cut the image into the thinest possible horizontal slices and that we
simply put them further apart from each other, on a black background.
That would be sine synthesis.
</p>

<p>Now, that last method has an obvious issue, it cuts the continuity
between image features unless they already are thin distinct and
perfectly horizontal. And that's the main thing to remember about this
method, it cuts the vertical continuity. You can hear the effects of
this by synthesising from a diagonal line, or most noticably from noisy
sound spectrograms, like drums. These need the vertical continuity of
noise synthesis for the result to sound right.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, noise synthesis has its own flaw. Because of the
relationship between a sound's spectrum and its envelope, this method
makes envelopes of the sound it makes noisy, irregular. In simpler
terms, it will make a piano, guitar note or human voice sound quite
'bubbly'.
</p>

<p>That's why it's relatively important to think of all sounds as either
sines or noises. The way to do it is simply to look at a spectrogram and
consider anything that looks noisy and covers an area as made out of
noise, and anything looking like thin continuous lines as made out
sines. On the other hand, noise synthesis is by far the best general
purpose synthesis mode, and as such it'll be most of the time the best
choice of the two synthesis modes.
</p>

<a name="param">
<h4>4.3. Selection of parameters</h4>

<p>Minimum and maximum frequency determine how low to how high the range of
sound we care about goes. It's usually a good idea to let it cover the
entire human hearing range, which ranges from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.
Because there isn't much to hear under 30 Hz, and because A0 (also known
as La 0) is right at 27.5 Hz, and because most adults hear little above
16 kHz, I usually make the lower frequency limit be 27.5 Hz and the
upper limit be between 16,000 and 20,000 Hz.
</p>

<p>The bands per octave parameter, or bpo for short, defines the frequency
resolution, which can also be thought of as the image's vertical
resolution.
</p>

<p>It is crucial to note that a higher vertical resolution means a lower
horizontal resolution. This has to do with the fact that the higher the
frequency resolution, the smaller the bandwidth gets for each band, and
that bandwidth equals half the band's envelope's resolution. Therefore
the quality of the results in analysis mode depend a lot on this
parameter, and the choice for this parameter depends a lot on the type
of sound.
</p>

<p>Basically, time resolution-demanding sounds like drums, explosions and
such are best reproduced with the bpo parameter set between 2 and 6.
Human voice, most types of music and high-pitched sounds require between
12 and 60 bpo. However feel free to experiment with various other settings.
</p>

<p>Bands per octave means how many horizontal pixel lines there will be in
an octave. Note that there are roughly 9.5 octaves in our hearing range.
Also, because there are 12 semi-tones in an octave, it's best when
dealing with music to choose multiples of 12. Used with a minimum
frequency set of 27.5 Hz (or a power of 2 of it) it guarantees a neatly
pitched reproduction of music notes (provided nothing is out of tune to
begin with).
</p>

<p>The pixels per seconds (pps for short) parameter is independent from any
other. It defines the time resolution (independently from the
aforementioned limitations) and thus the width of your image. Whereas
you might expect to need about 1,000 pps, it turns out you actually only
need about 100. 30 pps is quite the lower limit of usability, and you'll
rarely need as much as 300 pps, no matter what you're doing. Besides, if
you want to analyse an entire 4 minute-long song, keep in mind that even
at only 100 pps the resulting image will be 24,000 pixels wide, which is
about 20 times larger than your average PC screen.
</p>

<p>It is important to note that four of the parameters, image height,
frequency resolution (bands per octave) and minimum and maximum
frequency are interdependant, and because in synthesis mode the image
height is set by the input image, you can only define two of the other
three parameters. If you hesitate about which of these paramters to
omit, choose maximum frequency.

<h4>5. Command Line Parameters</h4>

<p>These are the command line parameters recognized by ASPERES version 0.3.0:
</p>

<u>Stand alone switches</u>

<p>
<b>-h</b><br>
Display help, i.e. a list of command line arguments with a short
explanation.
</p> 

<p>
<b>-v</b><br>
Display the version of the program as well as the last code
modification date.
</p> 

<p>
<b>-q</b><br>
Quiet mode, meaning the program will not ask you for any direct
input and will not output text to the console. Useful for scripting.
</p> 

<p>
<b>-l</b><br>
Linear frequency scale. Produces an output similar to most other
available spectrographs.
</p> 

<u>Options with arguments</u>

<p>
<b>-m [ anal | sine | noise ]</b><br>
Specifies the program's operation mode. You should chose one of the
options listed between the brackets.<br><br>

anal = spectrogram creation mode (sound to image)<br>
sine = sine synthesis mode (image to sound)<br>
noise = noise synthesis mode (image to sound)<br>
</p> 

<p>
<b>-f [name]</b><br>
The name of the input data file.
</p>

<p>
<b>-o [name]</b><br>
The name of the output file to create.
</p>

<p>
<b>-c [name]</b><br>
Use the configuration file [name] instad of the default 'asperes.ini'.
</p>

<p>
<b>-i [float]</b><br>
Minimum frequency in Hertz, restricted to the range 10-500 Hz.
</p> 

<p>
<b>-a [float]</b><br>
Maximum frequency in Hertz. Note that it's OK if it goes beyond the
Nyquist frequency (the highest frequency that can be present in a
digitised sound) regardless of the operation mode. Restricted to the
range 1000-20000 Hz.
</p> 

<p>
<b>-b [integer]</b><br>
Frequency resolution in Bands Per Octave. This setting should not be
used together with linear frequancy scale ('-l' switch). Restricted
to the range 1-64.
</p> 

<p>
<b>-p [integer]</b><br>
Time resolution in Pixels Per Second. Restricted to the range 10-300.
</p> 

<p>
<b>-y [integer]</b><br>
Specifies the desired height of the spectrogram.
</p>

<p>
<b>-x [integer]</b><br>
Specifies the desired width of the spectrogram. The actual output
size may be 1 pixel shorter or longer.
</p> 

<p>
<b>-r [integer]</b><br>
Sample rate of the output sound. Must be specified in synthesis
mode, the recommended value for most sounds being 44100. Restricted
to the values 8000, 11025, 22050, 44100, 48000 and 96000.
</p> 

<p>
<b>-g [float]</b><br>
Brightness of the image, a bit like gamma correction. Restricted to
the range 0.1-2.0. The program applies the formula 'f(x) = x^1/brightness'
to output images, and 'f(x) = x^brightness' to input images. The default
value is 1, giving the image a linear intensity scale and a dynamic range
of 48 dB, but because this is usually very dark I often use a value of 2,
which is equivalent to a square root on the output/square on the input,
and extend the dynamic range to about 96 dB. The dynamic range of the
spectrogram is given by 'brightness * 48 dB'.
</p> 

<p>As a minimum, you should specify the options '-m', '-f' and '-o'. '-o'
may be omitted. In this case the name of the output file will be automatically
created by appending '~' to the file name part of the name of input file (i.e.
its name w/o the extension).

<a name="sect6">
<h4>6. Configuration files</h4>

<p>Config files must be pure ASCII so please, don't use MS Word or similar
word processors to write them. Notepad is fine.
</p>

<p>Every line in a config file must be either a comment (starting with the
character '#' in the very first position), an empty line, or the definition
of a parameter. Parameters are defined as name/value pairs separated by white
space:
</p>

<p>[name]  [value]</p>

<p>[name] is the name of the parameter being defined, while [value] is a string
representing a number (integer or float) or a name, depending on the type of
parameter being defined. Please, consult <a href="asperes.html#sect5"> Section
5</a> for the type of values required. The following parameter names are
allowed (the corresponding command line options are shown in parentheses):
</p>

<pre><tt>
  MinFreq      (-i)
  MaxFreq      (-a)
  BandPerOct   (-b)
  PixPerSec    (-p)
  GammaCorr    (-g)
  WavRate      (-r)
</tt></pre>

<p>For an example see the default config file 'asperes.ini' supplied in the
archive.
</p>

<p>
Please note that all the parameters listed above must be defined in the
config file you want to use, otherwise the program will abort with an error
message.

<h4>7. Building and installing the program</h4>

<p><i>
<b>Note for Windows users:</b>
If you want to build the program yourself, you should have a recent
version of the MinGW development environment installed. You can get
it <a href="http://mingw.org">here</a>. Install the MinGW system, then
create an environment variable called MINGW and set its value to the path
of the install directory of MinGW (e.g. 'c:\compilers\mingw').
</i></p>

<p>
Extract the archive 'asperes-src-0.3.0.zip' to a suitable location on
your hard disk (e.g. 'c:\dev' or /usr/local'). A new folder called
'asperes-0.3.0' will be created. Navigate to the build directory called
'asperes-0.3.0\win32' or 'asperes-0.3.0/linux' and run the build script
'mk.bat' or 'mk', respectively. In a few seconds you should have the
executable 'asperes.exe' or 'asperes' ready in the build directory.
</p>

<p>
There are three scripts to test if the newly built program works correctly.
They can be used as follows:
</p>

<pre><b>
Windows:
p2s.bat [name] -> converts the sound 'name' to the image 'name~'
s2p.bat [name] -> converts the image 'name' to the sound 'name~'
s2s.bat [name] -> recreates the sound 'name' as sound 'name~'

Linux:
p-to-s [name] -> converts the sound 'name' to the image 'name~'
s-to-p [name] -> converts the image 'name' to the sound 'name~'
s-to-s [name] -> recreates the sound 'name' as sound 'name~'
</b></pre>

<p>
A test image (image.bmp) and a test sound (sound.wav) are provided in the
folder 'asperes\data' for convenience.
</p>

<p><i>
<b>Note:</b>
ASPERES uses a couple of functions from the MUTIL library
('libmutil.a' in the build directory), a collection of assorted utility
functions. The description of the API of this library (mutil.html) can be
found in the folder called 'doc'.
</i></p>

<p>
Installation is very simple. You should copy the executable ('asperes.exe'
for Windows, 'asperes' for Linux), the shared FFT library 'libfftw3.dll'
(Windows) or 'libfftw3.so.3.1.2' (Linux), and the default configuration file
'asperes.ini' to a suitable location (e.g. 'c:\asperes' or
'/usr/local/asperes').
</p>

<p><i>
<b>Note for Linux users:</b>
You may instead install the FFT library to a 'standard' location like
'/usr/local/lib'. Anyway, regardless where you put it, don't forget to
create the required symbolic links (in the same folder) so that the chain
of links is 'libfftw3.so' --> 'libfftw3.so.3' --> 'libfftw3.so.3.1.2'.
