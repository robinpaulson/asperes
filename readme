Audio Spectrogram and Re-Synthesis (ASPERES)
********************************************

This is a utility based on the 'Analysis & Resynthesis Sound Spectrograph'
(ARSS) program originally created by Michel Rouzic (http://arss.sf.net).
ASPERES can convert a WAV sound to a BMP image (spectrogram), or an arbitrary
BMP image to a WAV sound file.

The development of ARSS has been abandoned by Michel in favor of a non-free
GUI version called 'Photosounder' that is more capable than ARSS. I have
taken up the development. I plan to add a simple GUI to create a free GUI
version that is easier to use than the original ARSS program.
