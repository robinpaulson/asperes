Audio Spectrogram and Re-Synthesis (ASPERES)
********************************************

This is a utility based on the 'Analysis & Resynthesis Sound Spectrograph'
(ARSS) program originally created by Michel Rouzic (http://arss.sf.net).
ASPERES can convert a WAV sound to a BMP image (spectrogram), or an arbitrary
BMP image to a WAV sound file.

The development of ARSS has been abandoned by Michel in favor of a non-free
GUI version called 'Photosounder' that is more capable than ARSS. I have
taken up the development. I plan to add a simple GUI to create a free GUI
version that is easier to use than the original ARSS program.

ARSS is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License version 2. See 'LICENSE'.

Reboot (2021)
=============
The code for this has not been worked on for some time, Laszlo appears to have
dropped the project. I will try to continue. There are a few things which need
fixing before development can progress:
* Build the code for libmutil (see https://github.com/robinpaulson/libmutil;
  apparently it is part of "minisip", which has not been updated in 17 years.
* Build asperes on a modern, 64-bit system, the included binaries are from 2011,
  built for a 32-bit system
